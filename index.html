        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
When I lived in Auburn Ca., a craft/import beer bar called The World Pub opened up down the street from me and introduced me to real craft beer. After becoming good friends with the owner, he connected me with a local hard cidery, where I learned most of the transferable skills that landed me in craft breweries, including some major names such as Lagunitas and Anchor Brewing. 
<br>
<br>
To me, brewing means community. Beer brings people together from all walks of life. There's nothing like sharing a cold beer with friends, or making new ones over a pint. Beer introduced me to my wife who had been a brewer for another local brewery when we met, new friends all across the country, and countless adventures. Shortly after we met, my wife and I traveled the country as brewery consultants, where we got to work with and visit so many amazing breweries. Over the course of several years of traveling, we’ve always circled back to Tahoe where we feel most at home. When I’m not brewing, I’m enjoying all that tahoe has to offer with my family and dogs, disc golfing, or nerding out on beer and sci-fi/fantasy movies/cartoons/video games like the big nerd I am.
